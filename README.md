The Feynman Path Integral: A Tutorial Using d3.js
========

Introduction
========

The motivation for this project stems from a mixture of the practical and personal. First, Richard Feynman is a hero of mine so I love studying his contributions to science. Second, I'm a Bioinformatics analyst and live mostly in R and JavaScript for building dynamic web bioinformatic applications (mostly in network biology). So of course I wanted to merge the two worlds and pay tribute to Feynman with a tutorial on Feynman Path Integrals in d3.js.
